# DataExtractorMySQL
Data warehousing project
The Purpose of this code was to transfer data from one table to another table present in the database (located in folder 'dbtodb'). For it to run successfully, it is imperative to install wamp server or xampp server on the OS and run its mysql services successfully. I have used sublime text to code the entire script
The second folder 'dbtoexcel' reads a table in the database and copies it onto an excel sheet. The user can also select column wise where to copy the data gained from the table. wamp or xampp server is also required to run this script
